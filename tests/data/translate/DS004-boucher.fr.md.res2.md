Butcher
=======

1. Defining the activity
------------------------

### a. Definition

The butcher is a professional in the sale of meat. They may be required to process and prepare meat products, which they have previously purchased from wholesalers or slaughterhouses. He stores the parts, works them and sells them to his customers.

*To go further:* Law 96-603 of 5 July 1996 on the development and promotion of trade and crafts.

### b. Competent Business Formalities Centre (CFE)

The relevant CFE depends on the nature of the structure in which the activity is carried out:

 * For a craft activity, the competent CFE is the Chamber of Trades and Crafts (CMA);
 * for a commercial activity, the relevant CFE is the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI).

If the professional has a buy-and-sell business, his business is both artisanal and Commercial.


**Good to know**

The activity is considered commercial as long as the company has more than ten employees (except in the Lower Rhine, Upper Rhine and Moselle where the activity remains artisanal regardless of the number of employees of the company provided that it does not use an industrial process). On the other hand, if the company has ten or fewer employees, its activity is considered artisanal. Finally, if the professional has a buying and resale activity, his activity is both artisanal and commercial.
